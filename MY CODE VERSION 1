#define inverse  false
#define contrast 0xBE // default is 0xBF set in LCDinit, Try 0xB1(good @ 3.3V) or 0xBF if your display is too dark
#define bias 0x14 // LCD bias mode 1:48: Try 0x13 or 0x14
#define FontNumber 1 //1-6, 1 is default ,  Comment in  defines at top of  NOKIA5110_TEXT.h if using non default


void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  mylcd.LCDInit(inverse, contrast, bias); // init  the lCD
  mylcd.LCDClear(); // Clear whole screen
  mylcd.LCDFont(FontNumber); // Set the font
  mylcd.LCDgotoXY(1, 2); // (go to (X , Y) (0-84 columns, 0-5 blocks) top left corner
  mylcd.LCDString("The air quality in room:" then the intiger of air quality and then you can even add some IF statements such as if air quality is > 50 its normal and so on.); // use your data repersentations data to organise the air quality into sectors //maybe also add a button push or a delay which makes the stats change.
   mylcd.LCDString("The tempreture of so and so" then the thingy that will give the temp); //print first off when i ran the test the problem is that lcd is 2 small to show everything so you will have to add delays.
    mylcd.LCDString("secound air quality should do this before temp and have name above the intial quality to show which one has which readings." then the thingy that will give the temp);
    now i guess its just eh i have to connect all of them and add their libraries into this and then its be easy as hell. in fact maybe i can even get some of this done before tmr night. okay thats it for today.
}
}

void loop() {

}

This is to plan out everything that the lcd alone will do. so dont worry Mathew.
